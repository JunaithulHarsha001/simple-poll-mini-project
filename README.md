# Django Polls Project

This is a simple Django project I built while learning Django.
It is based on the official Django tutorial and helped me understand how
models, views, URLs, templates, and the admin panel work together.

## What this project does
- Allows creating poll questions and choices
- Users can vote on polls
- Results are shown after voting
- Admin panel is used to manage polls

## Built with
- Python
- Django
- SQLite (for local development)

## Project layout
- `pollproject/` – main project settings and configuration
- `polls/` – polls app (models, views, urls, templates)
- `static/` – CSS and images

## Running the project

1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone <your-repo-url>
